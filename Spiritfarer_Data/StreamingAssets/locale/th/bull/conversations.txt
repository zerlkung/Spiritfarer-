Yeah.
And think for a change.
Fat chance.

Nobody changes.
Anybody that tells you otherwise is lying.
Or trying to sell you something.
The only thing I’d rather be is true to myself.
That might make me an asshole in the end.

I can’t see beyond my back streets, my town, my friends, my family.
More importantly, I can’t see a life beyond my brother.
If he goes I go.
...
Funny thing is...
He went a long time ago.
I just didn’t want to admit it to myself.
I was holding on to something from the past.
My reputation.
My house.
My car.

It was nice while it lasted.
