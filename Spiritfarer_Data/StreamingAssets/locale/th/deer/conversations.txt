Seems I couldn't escape it, doesn't it?
Me being here, now.
You know me, I’ve never been one to dwell on the past.
Mainly because it always felt overwhelming to me.
Like an irrepressible wave of resentment.
But even at this very moment, I still wonder.
I don’t know if I’ve ever tried to connect.
And I’ve been so sure of it.
My opinion just never changed.
...
You know what I’ve always said.
That people come and go, but don’t pay attention to each other.
They never really did.
That lives are only ever parallel. 
Adjacent at best.
Well.
That’s bullshit.
...
I can see that now.
And you’re the proof of it.
And not just you, but Mum cared as well.
In her own way.
And others here, even given the circumstances.
I still don't know about father.
I should probably forgive him now.
Find that last shred of strength left in me.
Would that make me a better person?
Would that make a difference?
Maybe.
But after all this...
I don't think I care.
And it doesn't matter.
Because I had my best friend by my side.
I had you.
You are a wonderful person Stella.
My life would not have been the same without you.
The light you showed me was more than a beacon.
It was a guide.
Only I was too blind to see it.
My shades were too opaque.

Stella, I'm sure you remember my old sewing machine.
It was a Diva, with gold lettering and a manual wheel.
You know I've always been into textiles.
Well, a few years ago, I went to a museum which had tons of different sorts of fabric crafting machines.
And I couldn't help but notice that you can build a ((loom)) on this ship.
This could be a great opportunity for me to teach you a few tricks.
And I'm quite sure you'll need ((thread)) and ((fabric)) soon.
So you should definitely add a ((loom)) to this boat.
The resources for it should be simple to find.
Just check in your ((blueprint table)).

You should add a ((Field)) first in my opinion.
It's going to be easier to find the resources for it around here, and you can grow ((Flax)) in it.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Well. maybe not exactly like me.

You did good!
Now we've got a real boat going.
And you'll have to take care of these new passengers now.
They'll be the ones testing your patience, not me.
But, before all that, I have something to ask you.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}You might have noticed it by now, but sleeping in the ((Guest House)) is not the ideal scenario for any of us.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Especially since it's getting crowded in there.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Look, I'm not complaining you know.
You've been terrific up to this point, and it would be terribly rude of me to blame you for anything.
{|Expression_Pensive}But I think it's time for me to have a space of my own.
{|Expression_Blueprint}A nice little house, unpretentious but sophisticated, with a cosy vibe.
{|Expression_Blueprint}A space in which I could read and unwind, far from the turmoil of the deck.
{|Expression_Blueprint}Oddly enough, I'd see something with an Alpine flair.
See, even I can be filled with nostalgia sometimes.
Again, I won't be pushy on this, but I'd be delighted if you could build it for me.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And I almost did.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}If it wasn’t for my sickness, I could’ve made a difference.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}When I moved upstate, I had to have my piano and my sewing machine transferred.

{|Expression_Pensive}It's obviously slightly shabby, but let's commandeer it.
{|Expression_Pensive}I'd wager it will work, since you're the Spiritfarer.
Ok, meet me on the deck over there.
I'll explain it all.

{|Expression_Surprise}Stella!
{Expression_Gloom|Expression_Empathy}I...
{Expression_Gloom|Expression_Empathy}I'm sorry.
{Expression_Gloom|Expression_Empathy}...
{Expression_Gloom|Expression_Empathy}Sorry I even considered doing this.
{Expression_Gloom|Expression_Empathy}Ending your days in your family house is so cliche to boot...
{Expression_Gloom|Expression_Empathy}...
{Expression_Gloom|Expression_Empathy}I can't explain myself either.
{Expression_Gloom|Expression_Empathy}I just wanted to finish it off you know.
{Expression_Gloom|Expression_Empathy}To decide on my own terms how I'd go.
{Expression_Gloom|Expression_Empathy}And not letting myself been taken away...
{Expression_Gloom|Expression_Empathy}I've been weak, I'm sorry.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Oh, the irony.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Crap, I feel so selfish now.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Sometimes, I wish I could've been like you.
{|Expression_Surprise}But rarely.
{Expression_Laugh|Expression_Unhappy}...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Ah, crap. 
{|Expression_Surprise}Hug me now.

I'm proud of you, you know.
You've got the hang of it.
This ship is definitely going in the right direction.
{|Expression_Unhappy}And, yes, also, literally.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}The downside is, this place is cramped now.
Didn't Albert tell you you could expand the size of this boat?
{|Expression_Headnod}You sure could go check at the ((Albert's Shipyard)).
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Probably won't come cheap this time.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}So be prepared to shell out quite a few ((glims)).

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}You've got two ((obols)).

{|Expression_Headnod}I'd try and add them there.
If we're lucky it might do something amazing.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}If not, you'll have wasted your time.
You should go see.

Good.
{|Expression_Headnod}Albert gave it to you for free?
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And he said he "loaned" the ship to you?
{|Expression_Unhappy}Ominous.
{|Expression_Unhappy}Hard to know what he has in mind but it doesn't sound reassuring.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Anyway, let's focus on the task at hand for now.
{|Expression_Headnod}Cleaning up this deck.
{|Expression_Pensive}You can go to your new ((Blueprint Table)) above your cabin and select the ((Move)) option.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}In it, you'll be able to remove any building and get back resources.
Go for it, I'll wait down here.

Stella, I've got to tell you.
{|Expression_Pensive}There is something I'd stumbled upon some time ago, and up until now it didn't seem that important.
{|Expression_Pensive}Brace yourself.
{|Expression_Pensive}Remember my parent's manor on the lake?
{|Expression_Surprise}As weird as this sounds, it's not too far from here.
{|Expression_Surprise}...
{|Expression_Surprise}Yes, I know.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}It makes me wonder about this world too.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I must admit, I've been actively trying to avoid it.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}At any rate, it's become hard to ignore.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}As I've spend much time with you here, I think I'm ready to tackle this challenge.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I'll probably only find regrets and sorrows there, but it's worth a shot.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I've added the location to your map.
I'll be ready whenever you are.

{|Expression_Empathy}Just a bit of time by myself.
{|Expression_Empathy}I knew going back to the villa was a bad idea.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Sorry, this doesn't have anything to do with you.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}You've been nothing but great since you found me on that island.

{|Expression_Happy}Much better than anticipated
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}So.
{|Expression_Pensive}The way I see it, this boat is yours now.
{|Expression_Pensive}Don't you think?
{|Expression_Headnod}Good.
{|Expression_Headnod}And as you're the Spiritfarer, welcoming stray spirits is your new job. 
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And once aboard, they will assume their true forms.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Well, it's my theory anyway.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Why are you looking at me like that?
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}You need to come here and give me a ((HUG)).
