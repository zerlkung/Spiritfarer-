{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}You're looking for someone? A famous woodworker?
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Oh, sure, of course. You're talking about my boyfriend.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Or I should say my +=ex=+ boyfriend.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I kicked him out of my house. Call it a disagreement.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}We haven't talked in a while, so I'm not sure where he could be.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}But as I know him, he's probably just hanging around in a park somewhere.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I know he has a favorite spot somewhere in ((Ambertown Park)).
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}He was never much of a doer...

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}You know what? I can't just let him fend on his own. He's so helpless.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I just wanted to teach him a lesson.
