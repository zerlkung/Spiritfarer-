People can be mean.
Really mean.
Why do they have to be?
My mom is mean sometimes.
Just like your friends after my play.
And it makes me sad when people are mean.
And sometimes, I cry when I'm sad.
But then I remember.
I remember what my dad used to say.
"Stanley, people are not really mean."
"Sometimes, their intentions just take the wrong path."
I don't hate your friends.
They’re not bad people.
That’s what my dad would say.
They just do bad things sometimes.

And I always regret it!
I don’t think that makes me bad.
Do you think my mom will be disappointed in me?
Disappointed that I had to go?
I tried!
I really tried!
But I don't think I did it.
I like it when I win!
But I couldn't this time.
I think it's ok.
It's ok to lose sometimes.
I really think it is.

But...
I'm...
I’m really scared.
I wish I would be a super hero.
And never be afraid.
I've hoped so much that this would be a nightmare.
If this is a nightmare, why can’t I wake up?
I was trying.
Trying and trying.
I wanted to wake up.
I always talked to myself.
"Stanley wants to wake up!"
But it never worked.
I never woke up.
It all felt so real.
And it made me sad.
So sad I could not think of anything but sadness.
You will take care of Jacob ok?
Jacob is a good beetle.
And he was my friend.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And how people didn't like it.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}It's okay.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}As mom says, they are entitled to their hope onion.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I'm not angry or sad anymore because of it.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Like...
{|Expression_EmpathyExpression_Sad}Big hat...
{|Expression_EmpathyExpression_Sad}...
{|Expression_EmpathyExpression_Sad}I don't think I can be here anymore.
{|Expression_Empathy}We should go to the ((Everdoor)).
{|Expression_Headnod}Will you come with me?
{|Expression_EmpathyExpression_Sad}I think I'm scared.
{|Expression_Headnod}I don't think I like new places that much, but if you're with me, I think it will be alright.
