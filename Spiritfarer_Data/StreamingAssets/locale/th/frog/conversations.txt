It was a fight to the death.
He would always win.
A meal could take him hours to prepare just right.
It took him so long.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Let me give you a hand.
{|Expression_Pensive}When you’re cutting logs, you need to make sure your measurements are accurate.
{|Expression_Pensive}Then, you cut.
{|Expression_Pensive}Measure twice, and, cut.
{|Expression_Headnod}You just need to keep your saw blade steady and on the cutting line.
{|Expression_Unhappy}If you don’t do it properly, you’ll end up losing a pinky or an arm.
{|Expression_Unhappy}Or something worse.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Just remember to be careful with this ((sawmill)).
