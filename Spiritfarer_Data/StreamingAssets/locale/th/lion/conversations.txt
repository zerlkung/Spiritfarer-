The second I saw you I knew you were someone special!
Someone who, no matter what happened, would always be there and do the right thing.
I could see that in people.

Her laugh made mountains tremble.
And everyone was happy when she was around.
I was happy.
I've always spent so much time making sure others were having fun.
Making jokes and being the funny guy.
But they only came for her, really.
Her majestic, raw, radiant soul.

I saw so much of me in you!
Your bravery, your sense of humor, your gusto!
I know it’s hard doing what you do...
Accompanying people towards their ends.
Takes more than guts to do something like that.
It takes a soul of steel!

Right here with you peanut.
Promise me to take care of Astrid when I’m gone ok?
And don’t miss me too much, will you?
I’ve never deserved you anyway...

Hey, have I told you about that time I was up on the coast right before the end of the war?
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Me and the other boys we were waiting on an evacuation convoy, after a long night of skirmishes.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}We had been slowly but steadily going through the occupied villages of the lower mountains, as the enemy retreated.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I had joined a more “regular” corps since most of the resistance fighters could now be out in the open.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}So there we were, 20 something boys aged 17 to 25, all of us tired but happy at the same time.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}We were winning you know!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}We decided to stop for the night in a little village that overlooked the coast.
At night, one of the mammas comes to us with a gigantic cauldron, full of pasta with tomato sauce!
Most of us hadn’t seen tomato sauce in years!
{Call}At the same time, we hear Marius, our youngest combatant, rushing in towards us yelling “leave me some, guys! It smells so good!”
He had been on scouting duty that night to check if there was anything fishy going on.
{|Expression_Surprise}And as he runs towards us, maybe 40 meters from where we were, we hear a very loud explosion and a big puff of smoke.
{|Expression_Surprise}A land mine. 
{|Expression_Surprise}They were not that frequent but happened nonetheless.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Most of us ran towards him, but I was the first there.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I’ll spare you the details, but it was obvious he wouldn’t make it.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}As I hold him in my arms, covered in blood, he weakly opens his mouth and tells me:
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}“Damn, Giovanni, I can’t believe I won’t eat this... No one gets my share ok?”
{|Expression_Idle_NeutralExpression_Depressed}And those were his last words.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}That moment will forever be imprinted in my memory.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}It will always remind me that life has to be lived for the simplest of things.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}A nice dish, a beautiful landscape, a gorgeous lady...
Yep! That’s what life is lived for!

{|Expression_Pensive}Working in sales wasn’t my thing and Astrid’s mother said she wanted to help us, so I told myself “hey sure why not”
{|Expression_Pensive}It was a reputable establishment, something fancy!
{Expression_Depressed}Not a drinking hole in which people would come to forget about their lousy lives...
So, one day, that client comes in.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Disheveled, obviously distraught, looking over his shoulder as if the dogs of Inferno were after him.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}He runs to the bar, grabs me by the collar, and tells me in panic:
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}“12 shots of your finest liquor!”
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Before I even have the time to come back with the bill, he’s almost through half of them.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}So I ask him: “Brother, what’s going on with you? Why are you drinking so fast?
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}To which he answers” “If you had what I have, you would be drinking very fast too!”
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Surprised and a bit scared, I flat out ask him: “What in heavens do you have?”
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}He then stands up right away, and tells me: 
{|Expression_Surprise}“Only fifty cents!” and dashes through the door...
{Call|Expression_Unhappy}Well peanut, it’s been 40 years, and I’m still laughing at this one...
