It seems to me you were quite surprised by my request to leave.
And it seems to me you still are.
But you have to understand, Stella,
That everything is but a meaningless arrangement of atoms.
Everything you've ever known, seen, or experienced.
Fortuitous circumstances.
In the universal chaos, mankind emerged.
Not a tiny bit more purposeful than the rest,
But with an incredible faculty:
That of creating meaning, however fleeting it might be.

key: owl/conversations.owl_lastvoyage_tendersequence_b.loctext -6564048203521540376 v3 Revised
I have no inherent meaning.
Neither do you.
But we can create, organize, put in order.
And thus create purpose and meaning.
Transcend the primordial chaos.
All of humankind does so.
We create machines that are useful. To take control.
Machines like the dreaded chair.
The one that subsumed me, made of me an object.
But maybe, also, that made me truly realize what impermanence means.
For our numerous creations only have meaning as long as they are useful.
My chair, when it finally became unneeded,
Became once again a heap of metal.
Melted back into the universal chaos.
Lost its inherent humanity.

key: owl/conversations.owl_lastvoyage_tendersequence_c.loctext 8169129602544723495 v3 Revised
Usefulness is an easy way to meaningfulness.
But not a trustworthy one.
It vanishes as quickly as we do.
And so it seems the only hope humanity has for transcendence is through art.
Meaningfulness pulled from our chaotic minds,
Not for utility,
But for its own sake.
And after the artist has been long gone,
Turned to dust,
The art remains.
And even after the last one of all humans
Will have returned to the primordial chaos,
Provided that we have protected it,
Art will remain.

key: owl/conversations.owl_lastvoyage_tendersequence_d.loctext 4548518296696019226 v4 Revised
And so it is that art alone is left in our wake.
The only veritable form of transcendence to ever have been in our grasp.
Proof of our existence, and of our pitiful efforts to raise from the chaos,
As would some unknown script from a long-gone power.

{|Expression_Pensive}Ideally, a project of this breadth would require a dedicated space to protect the more fragile pieces from the elements.
{|Expression_Pensive}But it also requires an office desk from which the curator can work comfortably,
{|Expression_Unhappy}As well as a waiting area, a front desk, some storage, maybe even a gift shop. Though we might manage without one...
{|Expression_Unhappy}What? A bit much?
{|Expression_Unhappy}On the contrary, Stella, I assure you that all of these are perfectly necessary!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Luckily, as a rational man, I realize that space might be an issue.

Well, seems you've crossed out everything on my checklist!
I must say, I'm positively enthused!
You have managed to set up quite the workshop on this boat, Skipper.
An impressive feat, to be sure!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}But!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Don't let your guard down!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}You never know how Art could ambush you at the tepid corners of frivolous battlefields!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And we won't let ourselves sink in the slimy grave of ennui, or worse, poor taste!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}At ease, skipper.

{Expression_MakingAPoint}It is with great pride and unbridled joy that I present to you:
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Happy}"Humanity's Legacy", my finest exhibition yet!
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Happy}Not too bad, don't you think?
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Happy}An official opening?
Oh, no, no, no.
You know how I am. The spotlight is not for me.
And besides, vernissages are a waste of time.
{|Expression_Pensive}Nothing but an opportunity for officials to run around,

{|Expression_Pensive}Well, you know what I mean.

Well then, I entrust all of this to your good care.
I know I can trust on you after I'm gone.
Oh, don't act surprised.
You very well know I'm not the one to hang around longer than necessary.
And I'm pretty confident I've done all I could here!
{|Expression_Headnod}Good old Gustav, always looking ahead!

Great news, Stella!
{|Expression_Pensive}I have just received a fantastic design for a fireplace!
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Pensive}Cold? Oh, silly you, it's not for heating up the gallery!
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Pensive}No, no, the hearth has been, since time immemorial, a central piece of any household.
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Pensive}It assembles the tribe, represents unity, warmth, and light against the harsh nature.
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Pensive}A symbol so fundamental that it is present in almost all cultures!
This piece is a reinterpretation of the concept. A comment, if you wish, on the collective.
I'm sure you will understand very clearly once it is built.

Stella!

key: owl/conversations.owlconversation-narrativebeat1validation.loctext 584780518460596758 v3 Revised
It just occurred to me, Stella.
This exhibition I've been feverishly toiling towards...
I've never really delved into any detail concerning it, have I?
Well, allow me to enlighten you.
As my assistant, it's the least I can do!
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Idle_Neutral}As you are well aware of,
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I've organized my fair share of exhibitions throughout my life.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}One might even say that it was my career,
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Although I prefer to think of it as my vocation.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}But every single one of them,
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Museum, private or public galleries,
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Festivals,
{|Expression_Pensive}Anti-fascist rallies,
{|Expression_Pensive}Corporate tax schemes,
{|Expression_Pensive}Living performances.
{|Expression_Pensive}Every single one of them has been corrupted by base,
{|Expression_Pensive}Obtuse,
{|Expression_Pensive}Cretinous politics.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}"The public is not ready for this one, Gustav."
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}"This artist slept with this one, and there's some bad blood."
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}"The Queen has a preference for this tepid piece of art bourgeois."
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I've never, not even once, been allowed free reign over an exhibition.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I often thought to myself:
{Expression_Pensive|Expression_Idle_Neutral}"Gustav, you'll be respected when you get older.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}No one would dare question your gusto!"
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}But then, well..
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}You know what happened.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}When my body gave out, and my legs became obstinate as pieces of wood.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And the disease, slowly creeping up, until my features froze into a ridiculous grimace.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I didn't mind all that.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}After all, the body is but a tool for the mind.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And my mind has always been as clear as fresh spring water.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}No, what I loathed was this perception others had of me.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}When you turn into a grotesque statue of yourself...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}People start treating you as furniture.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}All this work, all those years...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}The sacrifices, the humiliations...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}These, suddenly, lost all worth.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I tried to keep up with my work, as you remember.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And thanks to your help.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}But things were never quite the same.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}...
{|Expression_Headnod}Well, this time, it will be different.
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Surprise}This exhibition will be pure chaos.
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Surprise}A maelström of artistic sensitivities,
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Surprise}Thrown together in defiance of all human laws.
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Idle_Neutral}To enforce this greatest message of transcendence through beauty...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Yes, that is my goal, now.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And yours, too, should you choose to keep helping me!
I'm sure you will.

{Expression_Negative|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Oh, the humiliation!
{Expression_Negative|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Stella, I'm just absolutely livid!
You wouldn't believe what just happened!
Some no-good, foul-mouthed miscreant just had the audacity to call me...
I can't even say it...
{Expression_Negative|Expression_Idle_Neutral}+=An art collector!=+
Completely, utterly unacceptable!
Who? I won't tell you.
I am a man of honor! Of principles! Certainly not a petty tittle-tattle!
Art collector...
As if I were one of these base mercantile creatures.
What an insult!
Narrow-minded fool. I am no art collector!
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I am a +=CURATOR=+!
I do not amass, evaluate, weigh and risk!
I do not trade!
I protect! 
I alone ensure the legacy of humanity's greatest achievements!
What? Overreacting? Have you gone mad?
{Expression_MakingAPoint|Expression_Unhappy}I thought better of you, Stella!
{|Expression_Unhappy}...
{|Expression_Unhappy}Then again...
Perhaps crude sensitivities need to be cultivated.
And perhaps that is also the essential role of the curator.
...
As usual, you get me thinking, skipper.
Maybe I'll cool down, just a bit. Some good may yet come out of this.

{Expression_Pensive|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Good thing you are taking care of the food, my dear.
{Expression_Pensive|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Let's see.
{Expression_Pensive|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Something that takes skill.
