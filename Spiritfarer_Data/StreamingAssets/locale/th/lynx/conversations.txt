{Expression_Happy}Simply stunning!
{|Expression_Headnod}Let me run you through the basics.
{|Expression_Pensive}This is a complex machine, and you have to be careful around it.
{|Expression_Pensive}First, you have to load ((ore)) in the furnace.
{|Expression_Pensive}Then, you have to throw ((coal)) in the burner to power it.
{|Expression_Pensive}The machine will then reach its working temperature.
{|Expression_Pensive}Then whatever ((ore)) you've deposited in the furnace will be smelted into ((ingots)).
{|Expression_Pensive}The bellows on each side of the furnace will make the heat go up.
{|Expression_Pensive}Each metal will behave differently, but once the right temperature is reached, the fusion starts.
{|Expression_Pensive}You'll have to make sure the temperature remains at the right level.
{|Expression_Pensive}Below it, the process simply stops, and above it, well...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}You don't want to see this happen, munchkin.
And that's it, I've told you all you needed to know.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}She has never been nice!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Running her mouth like that.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}She's the mean one of the bunch!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}But enough about her!
{Expression_Happy|Expression_Headnod}Thanks for bringing me here, Munchkin.
{|Expression_Pensive}So, Giovanni is in ((Loneberg))...
{|Expression_Pensive}Well...
{|Expression_Pensive}He usually hates winter.
{|Expression_Headnod}Let's go find him, Munchkin!

He agreed to everything you say?
{|Expression_Headnod}Wonderful!
You’re one hell of a negotiator, Munchkin!
I like you already!
Look, my work is done here thanks to you. 
{|Expression_Happy}I probably could embark with you on this fancy boat of yours!
I can’t wait to rest my old bones in a cozy home and have you by my side, Munchkin.
{|Expression_Headnod}See you there!

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}You’ll find up there the CEO of this company.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}He’s fled in his office and won’t come out.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Coward.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}See if you can convince him to face his employees, and have an honest dialog with them.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}We won’t budge before their conditions have improved!

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}As well as another week of vacation, and 5% on capital gains.

{Expression_Angry|Expression_Empathy}Why did I think he could change?
{Expression_Angry|Expression_Empathy}How could I hope he would've been any different?
{Expression_Angry|Expression_Empathy}This lying, cheating scumbag...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}...
{|Expression_Pensive}And you?
{Expression_Angry|Expression_Surprise}How could you do this to me?
{Expression_Angry|Expression_Surprise}Why did you feel the need to tell me the truth?
{Expression_Angry|Expression_Surprise}Don't you think some things are better left untold?
{Expression_Angry|Expression_Surprise}That some secrets deserve to stay unspoken?
{Expression_Angry|Expression_Surprise}I'm so mad at you!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Look, I know you believe you did the right thing.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}But, things are not that simple.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}It's not always a matter of honesty versus duplicity...

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}She's a tried and true blabbermouth.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And no, not the funny kind.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And yes, much worse than me.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I never took pleasure in destroying other people's lives.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}On the contrary!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Alright.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I should be able to pull off a little bit of acting here.
{|Expression_Headnod}Let's see if I can fake it?

There we are!
{Expression_Happy}I'm happy to see her munchkin!
She's always been a kind person, and we go way back, me and her.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}But I've got to tell you!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Last time we saw each other, things didn't end up that well.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}She might still hold a bit of a grudge against me.
{|Expression_Pensive}It's not my fault if I say things as they are!
{Expression_Angry|Expression_Unhappy}You don't always make friends by being honest...
{Expression_Angry|Expression_Unhappy}And you might even lose a few.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}But we're old now!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}So, canoe under the bridge, as they say.
{|Expression_Headnod}Follow my lead?

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I've been out of the loop on that island.
{|Expression_Pensive}You tend to lose track when you fight for the workers' rights!
{|Expression_Pensive}We should catch up on the latest gossip don't you think!
Oh but don't get me wrong, I don't really like gossip.
{|Expression_Pensive}But we need to stay informed!
In case important things happen!
And I know just the right person!
{|Expression_Pensive}An old friend of mine has been roaming the seas.
{|Expression_Pensive}She could probably tell us what's been going on.
{|Expression_Headnod}Are you game for a little adventure?
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Well, it's not like you have a choice.
She should be around.
{|Expression_Unhappy}She's gained a bit of weight recently, but don't tell her that!
{|Expression_Unhappy}She's always making a scene when someone mentions her appearance.
Let's go meet her.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}She had a lot to say, did she?
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Running her mouth like that.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}She's always been chatty this one, but I don't judge!
{|Expression_Unhappy}Also, I don't know if you've noticed, but her eyes are a bit scary.
{|Expression_Unhappy}Soothing and kind, for sure!
{|Expression_Unhappy}But scary.
{|Expression_Unhappy}I think she should talk to someone about this.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}But enough about her!
{Expression_Happy|Expression_Headnod}Thanks a lot for having brought me to her Munchkin, it's really appreciated!
There is always so much going on, I can't get enough of it!
{|Expression_Pensive}Also...
{|Expression_Pensive}What she said about that Giovanni character...
{|Expression_Pensive}Well...
{|Expression_Pensive}...
{|Expression_Pensive}Mmm, you know what?
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Never mind.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}We'll have ample time to talk about this later.
