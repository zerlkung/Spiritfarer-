{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Their master, the war-chief Omgrothog "One-Eye" is Gor-Nemloth's vassal.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Surely, the Orcs will maneuver to ambush us at the faintest of opportunities.
{|Expression_Pensive}In fact...
{|Expression_Surprise}Quick! Roll Initiative!

{|Expression_Surprise}Ready yourself!
{|Expression_Surprise}And, Commander!
{|Expression_Surprise}Some of these foes will be protected by Gor-Nemloth's nefarious magic!
{|Expression_Surprise}Only your ((Light Burst)) ability can shatter their protection!
{|Expression_Surprise}May the fight begin!

A chapter of her adventures might be completed, but her story is far from over!
Rejoice, free people of the world!

It’s always a good moment when we’re in between games to browse through your character sheet and think of what you’ll do next with your XPs!
But don’t worry, I’ll soon be ready!
{Expression_Happy|Expression_Idle_Neutral}What did you think of the beginning of Gor-Nemloth’s story arc?
{Expression_Happy|Expression_Headnod}Pretty cool eh?
I’ve taken as a basis the “Dungeon of Destruction”, sprinkled here and there a few elements from the “Masks of Imhotep” and added the single best magic item from the “Royal Campaign”.
Ah and...
{|Expression_Pensive}I’ll let you in on a little secret...
{|Expression_Pensive}Remember One-Eye Omgrothog from the “Three Towers”?

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}We are pirates!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}We will live forever!
{|Expression_Pensive}Everyone knows the best pirate crimes are committed at night.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}We can now steal treasure instead of sleep.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Hidden bounties to be discovered.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}No more Z’s for this crew.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Onwards, O Great Pirate Captain.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Let’s take this ship for its twilight maiden voyage!

Maiden!

There is beauty in voyage.
I say we just take a normal, regular voyage.
It needs to be long.
If you get bored, you can always talk to me.

This place...
This reminds me being in school.
We actually had a sailing class.
I know all the nautical terms.
...
Just don't quiz me.

That was good.
I don't always get to talk about myself.
I usually a bit off.
I like hiding behind a character.
Thanks for listening, Stella.

Stella!
You have to check this out.
I subscribed to it a few weeks ago.
{Expression_Happy|Expression_Pensive}It's the famous Looter’s Literary Review!
{|Expression_Pensive}...
{|Expression_Pensive}What?
{|Expression_Pensive}Are you kidding me?
{|Expression_Pensive}You don't know what this is?
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}It's just the most epic treasure hunting magazine in the world!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}The guy who writes it "Kaspar Crayford".
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Obviously a pseudonym.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}For security reasons, I assume.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Anyway, I just got my first issue.
{Expression_Happy|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Open it up!
