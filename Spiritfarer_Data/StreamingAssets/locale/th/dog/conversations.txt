So, you were my first time student in this... place.
I don't think you deserve a passing grade.
I won't hold it against myself.
And neither should you.
A lesson you should learn from this:
If life is hard, you should not be hard to it.
People have the ability to change.
You have the ability to change.
You can shape how you want to be.
...
I know that this is sometimes a tradition.
The passing of a legacy.
A token at the end.
An heirloom.
Something for you to remember my time here.
I do not wish to give you one.
However, I have prepared something greater.
Tasks and requests from the great beyond.
That you will receive.
A useless object will not make you think of, but lessons will.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}She had lost her mother and had a difficult time concentrating.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Her day-to-day struggles were immense.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}However, she was determined.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}She wanted this prestigious scholarship.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}It took coaching, after-school lessons, phone calls to her dad.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}She did not get that scholarship.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}She didn’t have a chance.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}She learned that even when you try hard, you might fail harder.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Like, I said, it’s a numbers game.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}She would never be the same.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Neither would I.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}It wasn’t a cakewalk for the gifted ones either.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}They had their own challenges.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}They were just open to the test.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}They were rewarded handsomely for their dedication.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}The weak ones, as much as the gifted ones, had a monster to tame.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}That monster was me.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I am the enemy they would remember.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I am the dragon they would have to slain.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}With hard work.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And complete dedication.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Or they could whine and quit.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And be out of my sight forever.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}...
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I never really felt useful teaching the gifted ones.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Nor did I take pleasure in breaking the spirits of the weak ones.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Seeing them just struggle.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Not knowing why these challenges were forced upon them.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}They did this to themselves.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}They had to be there, in class.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}They had one task: to listen.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}They were barely able to do that.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And I loved every second of it.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Because through hardship, they would learn.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Learn how to survive
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Learn how to be better.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Learn how to stop being burdens, and becoming leaders.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I have one memory I particularly cherish.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}It was one day after a particularly rowdy gym class.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}They came back to my room.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Fuming with hormones and desperation.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}One of my first years on the job.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}“Shaping the minds of the youth,” they told me.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Anyway, I couldn’t control any of them.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}They wouldn’t keep still for a second.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I wasn’t shaping anything that day.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I snapped.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I started screaming.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}It was the only thing those monsters could understand.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I told them truths that would only reveal themselves later in their lives.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}When you lose a parent.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}When you lose your best friend.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}When you lose your job.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}When you start to really crumble from the inside.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}After an episode like that, I should have learned a lesson.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I didn’t.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I vowed to focus on talent and excellence.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I vowed to never let go again, and steeled my resolve.

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I used to be a teacher.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I still am.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Back then, I had a classroom.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}In the kind of school that made sure each student passed.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}The kind of school "that teaches that" money can buy everything
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And every September, it was full of students ready to learn.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Each year, however, they failed to impress me.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Chatting amongst themselves.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Passing glances around.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Closing their ears and their minds to my lessons.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Immature little shits.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}All of them.
