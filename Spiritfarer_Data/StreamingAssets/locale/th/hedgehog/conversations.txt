{Expression_Interested|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I didn't think I'd ever see one with my own eyes.
[lookStella]{|Expression_Pensive}Remember?
{|Expression_Pensive}It's by climbing one of these that Ansgar managed to get away from Harald's gang!
{|Expression_Happy}"A treacherous and icy cage, that claimed many a young daredevil's life."
But of course, Ansgar managed to escape with the Countess' sapphires with ease and grace!
{|Expression_Headnod}Yes, he was quite the cat burglar!
{Expression_Laugh}Oh, look at me, I'm swooning, just thinking about it!

{Expression_Interested|Expression_Pensive}Just as I pictured it! How uncanny!
[lookStella]{Expression_Interested|Expression_Headnod}Doesn't it remind you of the shrine where Ansgar offered the sapphires to Agneta?
{|Expression_Happy}"I would have stolen a hundred gemstones, and fought a thousand ruffians,
{|Expression_Happy}For the opportunity to gaze upon your beauty, but for a second".
{Expression_Happy}Oh, how romantic!
{Expression_Happy}And then she confessed her love,
{|Expression_Pensive}And then they...
{|Expression_Pensive}...
{Expression_Interested|Expression_Happy}Well, you know what happened next!

{Expression_Interested|Expression_Pensive}Oh, and this dark, windy spot...
{Expression_Happy|Expression_Happy}Just like the scaffoldings where Ansgar and Harald dueled.
{|Expression_Headnod}Oh, I can see the scene so clearly,
{|Expression_Surprise}The clicking of the swords,
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}The distant barking of dogs, and whistling of the policemen.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Even the smoke reminds of the train station below!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And then, glinting in the shadows, a small needle-like knife,
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And just as Ansgar has adeptly disarmed his opponent...
{|Expression_Surprise}The treacherous Agneta emerges, and stabs Ansgar in the back!
{Expression_Sad|Expression_Surprise}Of course, how could Ansgar know that she was the half-niece of the cruel Harald!

{Expression_Interested|Expression_Pensive}And finds that he is cornered by his opponents.
{Expression_Interested|Expression_Idle_Neutral}With nowhere to go, they know it is but a matter of time
{Expression_Interested|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Before they can deliver him to Duke Fredrik,
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Ansgar's long-estranged twin brother,
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And usurper of the family title!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}But Ansgar, elegant to his last breath,
{|Expression_Pensive}Raises a hand in farewell, smiles softly and,
{|Expression_Pensive}Just as he is engulfed by the smoke from the locomotive below...

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I've had that lately, right?

{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Luckily for her, her house stands directly on the deck.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I imagine she would be pretty lonely, cooped up in there.

{|Expression_Pensive}I'm not sure she'd tell you, but I think she's stuck up there.
{|Expression_Pensive}Maybe you could ((move)) her house down to the deck level?
{|Expression_Pensive_to_Idle}I'm sure that would help her.

[CancelTimer]{|Expression_Headnod}Oh, you're tired, aren't you?
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Of course, so many children are bound to leave you exhausted.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}Maybe we could play with them a bit? Let you rest?
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}All you have to do is bring all the little babies to their mummy.
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}They have a lot of energy, so you'll have to be nimble!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}And sometimes, they will burst into a frenzy!
{|Expression_Idle_Neutral}In that state, they'll have so much energy to give!
What do you think, Stella?

Just catch and bring them back to their mommy!

{Expression_Sad|Expression_Idle_Neutral}I'm having a hard day, that's all.
